# Newser <br>

<i>Newser</i> is a news application build for Android with a few integrated news sources, for example RTL Nieuws, The Verge, CNN etc.
All the news articles are tapped from Newsapi.com: an API where developers can fetch posts from all kinds of different news sources and blogs. It can even provide a list of top headlines from the news sources of a specific country.
